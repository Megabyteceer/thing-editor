## What is ready:
 - Scene tree editor (no drag and drop yet);
 - Property editor;
 - MovieClip component with physic-based timeline;
 - Portrait/landscape switching;
 - multilanguage text;
 - build project as release folder;
 - load custom user components form project's js folder
 - postponed resources loading for each scene

## What is need to do:
 - drag and drop for "scene-tree" and "classes list"
 - examples and documentation
 
### How it is works:
Editor uses nodejs as local server to access project's filesystem, and chrome as UI.

Documentation is coming-soon. Use example project to understand beginigs.
Use double click on component in scene tree - to open component's source file to view and edit.
Work still in progress.
